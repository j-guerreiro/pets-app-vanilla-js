# Pet listing APP

This is a simple web development project with the aim of learning by doing.
The basics of web development is often overlooked, with that in mind and for learning purposes I will try
to squeeze the most as possible from these 3 basic web technologies (HTML, CSS and JS), and will add more complexity
and layers of functionalities during the course of the development.

The idea of this project is to create a listing of pets that are added to the site, for displaying with basic visual
pet information.

You can check the live app on https://pets-app-vanilla-js.vercel.app/ on its current state.
